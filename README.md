### What is Brave Frontier Summoner Level Calculator
Brave Frontier Summoner Level calculator allows summoners to expend their energy efficiently, resulting faster leveling. While quests pages in the Wiki shows quests with the best XP / energy, doing these quests in a greedy manner might not give you the best XP for your current energy.

### Why should I use


#### Senario 1: I want to use up all my energy before I sleep, what quests give the most XP?
Suppose I have 17 energy now, and want to use them all. Looking up the Wiki pages, I found that *The Fourfold Pillar* gives the best XP / energy. Doing that quest leaves me with 7 energy. Looking up the Wiki again, the best XP / energy quest is *Cave-Dwelling Assassins*.

Quest | Energy | XP | XP / Energy
--- | --- | --- | ---
The Fourfold Pillar | 10 | 2600 | 260
Cave-Dwelling Assassins | 7 | 550 | 78.57
**Total** | 17 | 3150

Using this calculator shows me that there are quests with even more XP.

Quest | Energy | XP | XP / Energy
--- | --- | --- | ---
The Phony Paradise | 9 | 2300 | 255.5555556
The Riotous Thunderbird 8 | 2010 | 251.25
**Total** | 17 | 4310

1250 XP more!

#### Scenario 2: I'm about to level up, should I do the quests now or wait for more energy?
Suppose I'm 3100 XP away from leveling, and have 16 energy now. Again, we pick *The Fourfold Pillar* for the first quest and am left with 6 energy. Looking up Wiki for the best XP / energy, I should do *The Lusting Snake*.

Quest | Energy | XP | XP / Energy
--- | --- | --- | ---
The Fourfold Pillar | 10 | 2600 | 260
The Lusting Snake | 6 | 490 | 81.67
**Total** | 16 | 3090

Just 10 XP more to level! Now I'll have to wait 30 more minutes for 3 energy.
Using this calculator shows me that I can level with even less energy.

Quest | Energy | XP | XP / Energy
--- | --- | --- | ---
Rampage of the Giants | 14 | 3200 | 228.5714286
**Total** | 14 | 3200

5 energy less and 30 mins saved!
